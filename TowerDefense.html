  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <h3 style="font-family: Lucida Console;"> Devil Dog Defense is loosely based on the events of the First World War in which the United States Marine Corps earned the nickname "Tiefelhunden" or "Devil Dogs" by German Commanders.
The game itself is what is reffered to as a "Tower Defense" game, in which the player organizes 'towers' to damage incoming enemy fighters. In our case the game is based around WW1 style armaments destroying German Tanks & Motorized Cars as they attempt to clear the trenches.
